# Fund Follower

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/jorikankaan/FundFollower/_apis/build/status/buumi.FundFollower?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/jorikankaan/FundFollower/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

Small JavaFX program for showing development of some funds.
It downloads data from my web-server which tracks values of those funds
once per day and displays those in simple data and graph formats.

At the same time it serves as an simple introduction to JavaFX for me.
Currently it is rather messy but who knows if it gets refactored into
proper state at some point. :)
